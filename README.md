Lightroom Workflow Automation
=========
All photos


1) Rate 

X - Delete. Its blurry, dark, unsalvageable, there’s many other options to choose from of the same subject. More likely to be used for landscapes, street, etc and less likely to be used on photos of friends and family.

★☆☆☆☆ - Don’t delete, but I’m done with this photo. There’s better options to pursue, or it just didn’t turn out as interesting as I thought it would. Almost all photos of friends and family will get at least 1 star, unless the photo is FUBAR’ed.

★★☆☆☆  - This photo has promise. Advance it to the next round. Its okay to rank multiple photos of the same subject with ★★.


if ★ / ★★

2) Add Location - Self explanatory. Use the map module to place where they occurred. Would love to somehow automate this through Moves, Foursquare (cough cough Dolapo), or a standalone GPS device.


3) Confirm Location/Add Keywords

Confirm Location - While still in the Map module, confirm city/state/country, and possibly add sub location. Why there isn’t a LR preference to turn this on automatically after adding GPS, we may never know
Keywords - people, subjects, moods, and other things that can’t be captured by metadata. 
Because many photos will come out of this stage with no change, I use the Red Label (6) to advance them from this stage and give them the status of “Ready to Develop”


4) Make selects 

Use this time to compare similar  ★★ photos and look at collection as a whole to decide how many photos I want to develop. Those that are selected get a ⚑ Flag

If ⚑ Flag 

5) Develop - Worthy of a whole other writeup. But shoutout to VSCO presets.

Because Developing is a a long, subjective process, there’s really no good way to automatically advance photos to the next step. Instead, I use the Yellow (7) label to signify that I’ve started editing an image and Green (8) to signal that its done being developed


6) Final rating 

★★★☆☆ - Done developing and the result was meh. Its still a good photo, but I’m not overly impressed with it. Could possibly be used as filler for photo books that Guri and I are making. 

★★★★☆ - Developing made this photo even better. Its worthy of being shared to my Tumblr and Flickr. Absolutely must make it into our photo books.

★★★★★ - Hall of Fame. If I had a portfolio of photography, this would go in there. But I don’t. So really, this is just a way for me to return to my favorite photos. Maybe I’ll print them.
